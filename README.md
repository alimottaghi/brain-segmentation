# Semi-supervised Brain Segmentation

This repository contains a simplistic code for barin MRI segmentation task in the semi-supervised setting.
[The dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mateuszbuda/lgg-mri-segmentation) that is used here contains only 110 patients and is obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).
Also, some parts of this code are building on top of [this notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/mateuszbuda/brain-segmentation-pytorch).

For running the code follow the [supervised](supervised.ipynb) and [semi-supervised](semi-supervised.ipynb) notebooks.
